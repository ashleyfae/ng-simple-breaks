# NG Simple Breaks
Adds in [br] [clearleft] [clearright] [clearboth] [hr] [space] shortcodes to use in posts and pages.

NG Simple Breaks is based on the ["Simple Breaks" plugin by Hit Reach](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-breaks/). It's been recoded primarily to redo the TinyMCE buttons. "Simple Breaks" had reports of breaking the visual editor.

Available shortcodes:

* **br** - A line break
* **cl** - An empty div tag with clear:left attribute
* **cr** - An empty div tag with clear:right attribute
* **cb** - An empty div tag with clear:both attribute
* **hr** - A horizontal rule tag (hr)
* **sp** - An empty div which has a height set based on it's size attribute (in pixels) so size=10 translates as height=10px
